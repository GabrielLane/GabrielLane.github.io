<h1>About Me</h1> <!-- I made two different sub-sub-headers here -->
<hr>
<h2>Why do I code?</h2> <!-- I made this one an ordered list because it was originally going to be one big paragraph. -->
 <ol>
  <li>I tried coding for the first time recently when I found Thinkful!</li>
<li>I applied and I found out that coding is very simple and fun!</li>
<li>I've decided that it must be a great and fun way to make money.</li>
<li>There is a long road to mastery filled with all sorts of people and things to learn.</li>
<li>I am very excited to walk this long road, like the karate sage who sits beneath the waterfall.</li>
<li>Maybe one day I will have my own pupil, who will learn my "ancient arts."</li>
</ol> <!-- tell me i'm funny, please XD -->

<h2>Other things about me: </h2> <!-- this one also has two subheaders, however they are both unordered lists because they are not meant to be taken in any particular order -->

<li>Folk music</li>
